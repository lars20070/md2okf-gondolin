"""Build a Merkle hash tree over an OKF wiki.

Every ``*.md`` file is hashed over its **raw bytes**, and every directory over
its children's digests, so a change to any leaf propagates to exactly one chain
of parent directories and nowhere else. That is what makes change localisation
cheap: compare one root hash, and if it moved, descend into the single subtree
whose hash also moved.

Raw bytes, not frontmatter-stripped content: this is the integrity tool, so a
timestamp bump counts as a change. ``sizeokf`` is the one that measures prose.
