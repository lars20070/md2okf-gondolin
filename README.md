Compile Markdown documents into an OKF knowledge base with a coding agent.

Drop Markdown files into `md/`, run `make wiki`, and the [Pi coding
agent](https://pi.dev) writes a wiki into `okf/`: a page per topic, an index in
every directory, links between them, and a log of what each run changed. OKF,
the [Open Knowledge
Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf),
is a tree of Markdown files with YAML frontmatter and nothing else — no schema
registry, no server, nothing to install. The agent takes one source document per
run and folds it into the wiki already on disk, so documents accumulate rather
than overwrite. [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) is the OKF specification the wiki is built
against; the agent reads it at the start of every run, and it outranks any
other instructions.

## Requirements

- macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), or
  Linux with [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine). Docker Desktop is not
  required.
- [sbx](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases) 0.42.0 is required. sbx is experimental. A later version may break `md2okf`.
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key, which pays for the model the
  agent runs on.
- `make`, `git`, and `jq`, which the compile driver uses on the host.

## Quickstart

Install the sandbox CLI and sign in.

[macOS:](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/install/#install-on-macos)

```bash
brew trust docker/tap
brew install docker/tap/sbx
sbx login
```

[Linux:](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/install/#linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo REPO_ONLY=1 sh
sudo apt-get install docker-sbx
sudo usermod -aG kvm "$USER" && newgrp kvm
sbx login
```

Hand sbx your OpenRouter key once — see [Set up the OpenRouter
key](#set-up-the-openrouter-key). Then put your Markdown in `md/` and compile:

```bash
cp my-document.md md/
make wiki
```

Each document gets its own agent run, and each run reports the wiki's root hash
before and after (tool calls and agent prose stream in between):

```text
Compiling document md/my-document.md (iteration 1)
7f3c1a9d4e02 -> b481d05c6a17
Compiling document md/my-document.md (iteration 2)
b481d05c6a17 -> b481d05c6a17
```

The wiki lands in `okf/`, which is gitignored apart from `okf/.okflintrc.json`,
so the generated pages stay out of the repo. `md/` is tracked and ships with
sample documents, so `make wiki` has something to compile straight away.

## How it works

A shell driver on the host runs the agent inside a microVM, repeatedly, until a
hash of the output stops moving. The host drives; everything else happens inside
the sandbox.

`make wiki` throws the old sandbox away and builds a fresh one, so the current
kit — the `pi/` directory that declares the sandbox image, its network
allowlist and the agent's config — always applies. It then runs the agent once
per `md/*.md` file, re-running the same document (a *Ralph loop*) until
`merkleokf --nolog -L 0` reports an unchanged wiki root hash. `merkleokf` prints
a Merkle hash tree, one hash per file and per directory, so a change to any page
moves the root hash and an unchanged root means the run added nothing. The loop
is capped by `RALPH_MAX` (default 10). The agent's only writable output is
`okf/`, [okf-lint](https://github.com/thisismydesign/okf-lint) must pass before
it finishes, and `SPEC.md` outranks every instruction file. Each run streams
tool names and assistant text as it goes, and writes a session transcript under
`logs/sessions/`.

### Repository layout

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `md/` | source documents, one agent run each |
| `okf/` | the generated wiki |
| `Makefile` | every task worth running; `make wiki` compiles |
| `scripts/` | what the Makefile or the agent call — compile, sandbox shell, sbx kit validation, and the four helper CLIs (`inspectmd`, `inspectokf`, `sizeokf`, `merkleokf`) |
| `pi/` | what the scripts run: the Docker Sandbox kit and the config it carries |
| `SPEC.md` | the [OKF specification](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) the wiki is built against |
| `AGENTS.md` | instructions for coding agents working *on this repo*, not for Pi |
| `pdf2md/` | optional: converts a PDF into `md` |
| `web2md/` | optional: scrapes a documentation site into `md` |

## What lands in okf/

```text
okf/
├── index.md          # root index, the only one carrying frontmatter
├── log.md            # what each run changed, newest first
├── <page>.md         # a content page at the wiki root
└── <topic>/          # one directory per topic, nested as deep as it needs
    ├── index.md      # a plain link list for this directory
    └── <page>.md     # a content page within the topic
```

Content pages carry `type`, `title`, `description` and `tags` in their
frontmatter. Slugs are kebab-case. Links are bundle-absolute, so
`/glossary/verb.md` rather than `glossary/verb.md`. The root `index.md` names
the spec version the agent reads. Pages are updated in place, not duplicated, so
compiling the same document twice is safe.

## Getting Markdown in

`md/` wants clean, structured Markdown, and a source document is rarely that.
Two helpers produce it. Both are optional, and neither is part of `make wiki`.

**From a PDF.** `marker` converts one with the help of a language model, either
a local Ollama model or a cloud model through OpenRouter. Expect to check the
output, and run the step by hand — see
[the pdf2md guide](pdf2md/README.md).

**From a website.** `make scrape` walks a documentation site and writes one
Markdown document into `md/`. No model is involved, so the result is
deterministic, and the fetched HTML is cached — see
[the web2md guide](web2md/README.md).

## Set up the OpenRouter key

`sbx` keeps the key out of the virtual machine. It holds the real string on the
host and swaps it into requests at its proxy, so inside the sandbox
`$OPENROUTER_API_KEY` reads `proxy-managed`. Set it twice:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
echo "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" | sbx secret set openrouter

# And again as a custom secret, to work around a known sbx issue:
# https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases/issues/25
sbx secret set-custom --sandbox md2okf \
  --host openrouter.ai \
  --env OPENROUTER_API_KEY \
  --value "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
```

`md2okf` is the kit's name, which comes from `pi/spec.yaml`. `make wiki` reads
the key from `sbx secret`, never from your shell environment. To point the agent
at a different provider, see [the pi kit guide](pi/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

**`sbx` reports unknown fields from `pi/spec.yaml`.** Your sbx is older than
0.42.0 and does not know the kit-spec v2 grammar. Run `brew upgrade sbx`.

**A runtime command fails to authenticate.** `make wiki`, `make test-sandbox`,
`./scripts/bash.sh` and `./scripts/pi.sh` need an active `sbx login` session.

**`Error: Ralph loop hit 10 iterations`.** The wiki root hash kept changing.
Raise the cap for one run with `RALPH_MAX=20 make wiki`, or read
`logs/sessions/` to see what the agent was doing.

## Development

Lint, tests, the sandbox checks, the helper CLIs and the per-subproject layout
are covered in [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version:
`make lint` checks the source tree, `make validate` checks the sandbox kit spec,
and CI runs both on every pull request. There is no package to install —
`make wiki` is the entry point, and `make install-clis` puts the helper CLIs on
your PATH.
