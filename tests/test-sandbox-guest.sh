# POSIX sh, not bash: the guest shell is `sh`, so the `#!/bin/sh` shebang above
# is what makes shellcheck reject a bashism here rather than leaving it to fail
# inside the VM. Everything below relies on the login shell (`sh -l`) having put
# ~/.local/bin and the npm prefix on PATH.
#
# Deliberately no `set -e`: every check runs, and all failures are reported in
# one pass rather than stopping at the first.

# `command -v` first, then a uniform smoke run: `--version`, falling back to
# `--help`. That fallback is what makes CLIs with unknown flag support (pi,
# okf-lint, markdownlint-cli2, cspell) checkable without fixture files or
# hard-coding which flag each one accepts. `timeout` guards a tool that waits
# rather than prints. Output is discarded, so no version is asserted.
